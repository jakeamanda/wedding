<h3>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160Team Jamanda</h3>
<p>We met at our first job out of school working the bakery at a cafe. We share a love of Eachother, Video games(Pokemon), Fantasy, Books, Cooking, Baking, and Cats.</p>
<h3>Saffron</h3>
<img src="saffron2.jpg" alt "secret :)" style="width:50%;">
<p>Saffron, daughter of Fiona and Big Papa, niece to Midge and Gordy. She had a rough beggining on the tough streets of West Nyack underneath the Spanedda's deck. Her Grandma Elaine rescued her and her siblings, caring for them for a month or two before Saffron hissed her way into our hearts and home. Just like her namesake, she is a very spicy girl who hisses all the time, but she bloomed from an nervous kitten into an anxious adult. Saffron loves hiding in the bedroom all day, creepin' on us through our hallway mirror, staying up all night, scritches, chasing the laser pointer, watchin' chipmunks, her older brother Figgy, and she is perfect in every way. </p>
<h3>Asiago</h3>
<img src="asiago.jpg" alt "secret :)" style="width:100%;">
<p>Asiago, the goodest boy, until he isn't. Born in 2019 at Pets Alive Animal Sanctuary, Asiago was friendly and outgoing from the day he was born. Despite that, Asiago was passed up by several different people, always second place to another kitty. Their loss, they don't know what they're missin'! Asiago loves nothing more than cuddles, playing with us, going on walks in his kitty back pack, licking Jake and ONLY JAKE, sitting on our heads while we sleep, screaming for no reason at 5 am, swallowing his treats without chewing so he pukes, not covering his poop, watching the birds outside, napping, getting brushed, meeting new people, tummy time, rolling over while being pet, and he is perfect in every way, until he is bad.</p>
